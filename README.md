# ZSH Source / Configure Files

This repository serves as an ultimate backup in case all of my laptops and all of my backups break. In this event I can be reassured that my zsh shell won't look any different than usual. 

## Potential Projects for the Future 

1. Create list of relevant software including all customized settings (e.g. keybindings in RStudio and PyCharm) 
2. Make a small instruction file on how to get my setup back up running
3. Be sure not to miss any other customized source files (e.g. vim) 
4. Construct blog post on my setup, why it saves time and how to get it running on your system
