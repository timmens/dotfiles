# ZSH Source / Configure Files

This repository serves as my ultimate backup in case all of my laptops and all of my backups break. In this event I can be reassured that my zsh shell won't look any different than usual. 

## Potential Projects for the Future 

1. Make a small instruction file on how to get my setup back up running
2. Be sure not to miss any other customized source files (e.g. vim)
