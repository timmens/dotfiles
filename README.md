# Dotfiles

## About the Repository

On this repo I store my dotfiles and configurations to decrease setup costs on a new machine.
Further I list important applications I use (and where to find them).

## Status

This repository is still under construction and will be made useful for others by providing more files and detailed documentation by approx. July 2020.
