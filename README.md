## about this repository

Here I store some config files and a few scripts, I also list a few
programs that I use frequently..

Maybe at some point I consider writing scripts which automatically download and
setup as many of the below listed applications as possible. Until then, happy
``apt-get install'ing``.

**Any remarks and or suggestions are very welcome!**
